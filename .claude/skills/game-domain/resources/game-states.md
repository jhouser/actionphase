# Game States and Transitions

Complete reference for game state machine in ActionPhase.

## Game States

```sql
-- backend/pkg/db/schema.sql — NOTE: no CHECK constraint; values enforced in code
state VARCHAR(50) DEFAULT 'setup'
```

Canonical values are the `GameState*` constants in
`backend/pkg/core/constants.go`:

```go
GameStateSetup             = "setup"
GameStateRecruitment       = "recruitment"
GameStateCharacterCreation = "character_creation"
GameStateInProgress        = "in_progress"
GameStatePaused            = "paused"
GameStateCompleted         = "completed"
GameStateCancelled         = "cancelled"
```
